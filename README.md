Trying to make a Web Browser App with Rotation and fixing the reset from the website after a rotation.

First, I am trying to make it rotate from Vertical to Landscape without the WebView Reloading the website already loaded.

Second, I'm trying to get FullScreen function to work with any video from any website.

and Third, I'm trying to make it conserve the last point reproduced in the video and keep on playing when rotating it 
  from Landscape to Vertical and viceversa.
